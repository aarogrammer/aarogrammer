Glasgow-based Lead Software Engineer who still writes a lot of code. I’ve spent the last several years building backend systems and infrastructure across a range of environments — from containerised services running in Kubernetes and ECS to event-driven apps using Lambdas and other serverless tools.

My core strengths lie in backend development, system design, and infrastructure — designing microservices, working with queues and APIs, and ensuring services are reliable, observable, and easy to operate. I’ve worked across multiple cloud platforms and environments, and I adapt to what the team and product actually need.

As a team lead, I take ownership of technical direction, support engineers through code reviews and mentoring, and help drive architectural decisions across services. I focus on building systems that are not just functional, but also maintainable and well-documented — especially important in fast-moving teams.

I’ve contributed to shaping team workflows, improving CI/CD pipelines, and establishing standards around testing, security, and incident response. And while I lead, I stay hands-on — still solving problems, still shipping features, and still diving deep when needed.

🔧 Tools I work with regularly:

Backend: TypeScript, Node.js, REST, GraphQL, event-driven systems

Infra: Kubernetes, Docker, serverless (Lambdas etc.), certs, auth rotation

CI/CD & Ops: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, monitoring, incident handling.

I'm always open to connecting with engineers and technical leaders tackling hard backend or infrastructure challenges.
