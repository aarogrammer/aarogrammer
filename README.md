I am a Software Engineer from Glasgow, Scotland. I am predominantly a backend developer but have several years of experience with frontend development. My main stack is using Node.js with Docker (typically an alpine Linux distribution), MongoDB and/or SQL (Postgres, MSSQL) depending on the requirements. I work mostly on building microservices and deploying them to Kubernetes. The communication between microservices also depends on the requirements, but I am regularly using message brokers, REST APIs and GraphQL to bring everything together.   

With the use of Docker, most of the services I develop, regardless of the language, are deployed to Kubernetes. I typically create the K8s clusters, configure load balancers, ingress controllers and certificate management (TLS, auth rotation etc.).

I am also experienced with automating CI/CD pipelines, ensuring code quality and reliable deployments.
